Karate JSON Comparator

This project demonstrates how to use the Karate Framework with Java utilities to:

Compare multiple JSON response files across different test runs.

Detect structural differences (added, removed, or modified fields).

Summarize scenario-wise changes.

Optionally integrate with AI APIs (Azure/OpenAI/Gemini) to analyze and provide insights on the detected differences.
